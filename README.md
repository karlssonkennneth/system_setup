# My Configuration

This repository contains my configuration files that I want to share between my
machines.

I am staring with GNU Stow, the long term plan is to switch to Home Manager at
some point

## How to
Create folders for the different configurations that you want and run:

```console
$ stow "folder"
```
There are other configuration files that is not handled by stow, like Brewfile
and my Python requirement files.
